## Community Projects
Here you'll find some of the work we've open-sourced. Make sure to visit our [blog](https://blog.3coresec.com), check our detection marketplace at [dtection.io](https://dtection.io) _(where some of our rulesets are made available for free)_ as well as [3CORESec Blacklist 📓](https://blacklist.3coresec.net), our IOC sharing platform that makes a subset of the data from our honeypot network available to the public. 

We're often on Twitter ([@3CORESec](https://twitter.com/3CORESec)) and you can also join our [Community Slack](https://launchpass.com/3coresec) to hang out with us, talk about our projects, data-driven security and more.
